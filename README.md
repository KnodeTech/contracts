## Token terms per phases

### I. Testing

- Tokens are issued1 and used only for use of the service - service use "price-list": [1k] tokens are given to user per one evaluation/report created, one evaluation search/download costs [1k] tokens, etc.

- Maximum amount of tokens issued during this phase is [1m]

- Tokens are non-transferable to third-parties – use of tokens is limited only to the service and can not be used outside of the service (no liquidity).

- Smart contract is replaceable/modifiable by the owner

### II. Pre-ICO

- Maximum amount of tokens issued during this phase:

  - use of the service: [1m]
  
  - partners1: [5m]
  
  - pre-ICO investors: [10m]
  
- Smart-contract is to allow the owner to issue tokens to partners/pre-ICO investors in the amounts up to the specified above
  
- Legal entity set up and share distribution (including ESOP – tied to the token distribution to the team)

### III. ICO

- All token-holders as of the pre-ICO are automatically “whitelisted” subject to KYC processes

- At the start of the ICO, smart contract is modified by the owner to:
  
  - upgrade the token to erc20-compliant and remove all restrictions (free transferability, etc.) related to the tokens
  
  - make contract immutable

- ICO token distribution, including token distribution to the team – per the ICO token distribution terms

### IV. Post-ICO
- Token issuance and use are subject to the token terms
- Ecosystem development
